\[
4x^2 + y^2 + 16x + 4y - 44 = 0
\]

Group \(x\)-terms and \(y\)-terms:

\[
4x^2 + 16x + y^2 + 4y = 44
\]

Factor out 4 from the \(x\)-terms:

\[
4(x^2 + 4x) + (y^2 + 4y) = 44
\]

Complete the square for each group.

For \(x^2 + 4x\):  
\[
x^2 + 4x = x^2 + 4x + 4 - 4 = (x+2)^2 - 4
\]

For \(y^2 + 4y\):  
\[
y^2 + 4y = y^2 + 4y + 4 - 4 = (y+2)^2 - 4

Substitute:

\[
4[(x+2)^2 - 4] + [(y+2)^2 - 4] = 44
\]

Distribute:

\[
4(x+2)^2 - 16 + (y+2)^2 - 4 = 44

Combine constants:

\[
4(x+2)^2 + (y+2)^2 - 20 = 44

Divide by 64:

\[
\frac{(x+2)^2}{16} + \frac{(y+2)^2}{64} = 1

This is an ellipse in standard form:

\[
\frac{(x-h)^2}{b^2} + \frac{(y-k)^2}{a^2} = 1
\]
with center \((h,k) = (-2,-2)\).  
The larger denominator is under \((y+2)^2\), so the major axis is vertical.

- \(a^2 = 64 \Rightarrow a = 8\)
- \(b^2 = 16 \Rightarrow b = 4\)

For an ellipse, \(c^2 = a^2 - b^2\):

\[
c^2 = 64 - 16 = 48 \Rightarrow c = \sqrt{48} = 4\sqrt{3}

Because the major axis is vertical, vertices and foci are vertically above/below the center.

where \(a^2\) is under \(x^2\) and \(b^2\) is under \(y^2\).

Here,
\[
a^2 = 36 \Rightarrow a = 6, \qquad b^2 = 9 \Rightarrow b = 3.

Since \(a > b\), the major axis is horizontal.

To find the foci, use
\[
c^2 = a^2 - b^2 = 36 - 9 = 27 \Rightarrow c = \sqrt{27} = 3\sqrt{3}.

- Center at \((0,0)\)

Because the focus and vertex lie on the x-axis, the major axis is horizontal, and the ellipse has standard form  

\[

For a horizontal ellipse:

> A whispering gallery is to be constructed so that the foci are located 35 feet from the center. If the length of the gallery is to be 100 feet, what should the height of the ceiling be?

A whispering gallery is shaped like an **ellipse**.  
Assume the floor is along the major axis and the ceiling is the top of the ellipse.

---

### 1. Set up the ellipse

Let the center of the ellipse be at the origin and the major axis be horizontal.

- Distance from center to each focus: \(c = 35\) ft  
- Total length of the gallery (major axis): 100 ft  
  ⇒ semi‑major axis \(a = \frac{100}{2} = 50\) ft  

For an ellipse \(\dfrac{x^2}{a^2} + \dfrac{y^2}{b^2} = 1\),
the relation among \(a, b, c\) is:
\[
c^2 = a^2 - b^2
\]

Substitute \(a = 50\) and \(c = 35\):

\[
35^2 = 50^2 - b^2
\]
\[
1225 = 2500 - b^2
\]
\[
b^2 = 2500 - 1225 = 1275
\]

So
\[
b = \sqrt{1275} = \sqrt{25 \cdot 51} = 5\sqrt{51}
\]

### 2. Interpret \(b\) as the height

The semi‑minor axis \(b\) is the vertical distance from the center to the ceiling.  
Since the floor is at the center level and the ceiling is above it, the **height of the ceiling** equals \(b\).

\[
\text{Height} = b = 5\sqrt{51} \text{ ft} \approx 35.7 \text{ ft}

---

### 1. Group x-terms and y-terms

\[
3x^2 - 12x \;-\; (y^2 + 6y) - 9 = 0
\]

Factor the coefficient of \(x^2\):

\[
3(x^2 - 4x) - (y^2 + 6y) - 9 = 0
\]

---

### 2. Complete the square

For \(x^2 - 4x\):

\[
x^2 - 4x = x^2 - 4x + 4 - 4 = (x - 2)^2 - 4
\]

For \(y^2 + 6y\):

\[
y^2 + 6y = y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y + 3)^2 - 9
\]

Substitute:

\[
3[(x - 2)^2 - 4] - [(y + 3)^2 - 9] - 9 = 0
\]

Distribute:

\[
3(x - 2)^2 - 12 - (y + 3)^2 + 9 - 9 = 0
\]



Combine constants \(-12 + 9 - 9 = -12\):

\[
3(x - 2)^2 - (y + 3)^2 - 12 = 0
\]

Move 12 to the other side:

\[
3(x - 2)^2 - (y + 3)^2 = 12

C8-06,Complete,Incomplete,"We are given the conic

\[
2y^2 - x^2 - 12y - 6 = 0

1. **Rewrite and complete the square**

Group \(y\)-terms:

\[
2y^2 - 12y - x^2 - 6 = 0
\]

Factor out 2 from the \(y\)-terms:

\[
2(y^2 - 6y) - x^2 - 6 = 0
\]

Complete the square for \(y^2 - 6y\):

\[
y^2 - 6y = (y-3)^2 - 9
\]

Substitute:

\[
2[(y-3)^2 - 9] - x^2 - 6 = 0
\]

\[
2(y-3)^2 - 18 - x^2 - 6 = 0
\]

\[
2(y-3)^2 - x^2 - 24 = 0
\]

\[
2(y-3)^2 - x^2 = 24
\]

Divide by 24:

\[
\frac{(y-3)^2}{12} - \frac{x^2}{24} = 1
\]

2. **Identify type and parameters**

This is a hyperbola of the form

\[
\frac{(y-k)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(x-h)^2}{b^2} = 1
\]

so

- Center: \((h,k) = (0,3)\)
- \(a^2 = 12 \Rightarrow a = 2\sqrt{3}\)
- \(b^2 = 24 \Rightarrow b = 2\sqrt{6}\)

For hyperbolas, \(c^2 = a^2 + b^2\):

\[
c^2 = 12 + 24 = 36 \Rightarrow c = 6
\]

3. **Vertices and foci**

Because the positive term is with \((y-3)^2\), the hyperbola opens up and down.

- Vertices: \((h, k \pm a) = (0, 3 \pm 2\sqrt{3})\)
- Foci: \((h, k \pm c) = (0, 3 \pm 6)\)

So the foci are at \((0, 9)\) and \((0, -3)\).

- Foci at \((3,7)\) and \((7,7)\)  
- A vertex at \((6,7)\)

**1. Find the center and orientation**

The foci lie on a horizontal line \(y=7\), so the transverse axis is horizontal.  
The center is the midpoint of the foci:

\[
\left(\frac{3+7}{2},\frac{7+7}{2}\right)=(5,7).
\]

So the hyperbola has center \((h,k)=(5,7)\) and is of the form

\[
\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2}-\frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2}=1.
\]

**2. Find \(a\)** (distance from center to vertex)

The vertex is at \((6,7)\). Distance from center \((5,7)\) is

\[
a = |6-5| = 1 \quad\Rightarrow\quad a^2 = 1.
\]

**3. Find \(c\)** (distance from center to each focus)

Take focus \((7,7)\). Distance from center:

\[
c = |7-5| = 2 \quad\Rightarrow\quad c^2 = 4.

For a hyperbola, \(c^2 = a^2 + b^2\). Thus,

where \((h,k)\) is the vertex and \(p\) is the distance from the vertex to the focus (and to the directrix).

Match the given equation to this form.

\[
(x+2)^2 = \frac12 (y-1)
\]

First identify \(h\) and \(k\):
\[
(x - (-2))^2 = (x+2)^2,\quad y-1
\]
So \(h=-2\), \(k=1\).

Now compare coefficients of \((y-k)\):
\[
4p = \frac12 \quad\Rightarrow\quad p = \frac{1}{8}

Since \(4p > 0\), the parabola opens upward.

- **Vertex**: \((h,k) = (-2, 1)\)

where \((h,k)\) is the vertex and \(p\) determines the focus and directrix.

### 1. Match to standard form
\[
(y-1)^2 = \frac12(x+3)
\]

Rewrite the right side as \(4p(x-h)\):

\[
4p = \frac12, \quad x-h = x+3

So
\[
h = -3,\qquad 4p=\frac12 \Rightarrow p=\frac{1}{8}

Vertex: \((h,k) = (-3,1)\).

### 2. Orientation
Because \(p>0\) and the \(x\)-term is on the right, the parabola opens to the **right**.

### 3. Focus
For \((y-k)^2=4p(x-h)\), the focus is
\[
(h+p,\,k) = \left(-3+\frac18,\,1\right)=\left(-\frac{23}{8},\,1\right)

### 4. Directrix
The directrix is the vertical line
\[

### 5. Axis of symmetry
The axis of symmetry is the horizontal line
\[

### 6. Intercepts (for plotting)

- **x-intercept**: set \(y=0\):

- **y-intercept**: set \(x=0\):
  \[
  (y-1)^2=\frac12(0+3)=\frac32

C8-19,Step-by-Step,Wrong Answer,"We are given

\[
2y^2 + 12y + 6x + 15 = 0
\]

and asked to graph the parabola and label vertex, focus, and directrix.

---

### 1. Put into standard form

Group the \(y\)-terms and move the \(x\)- and constant terms to the other side:

\[
2y^2 + 12y = -6x - 15
\]

Factor out the 2:

\[
2(y^2 + 6y) = -6x - 15
\]

Complete the square in \(y\):

\[
y^2 + 6y = (y+3)^2 - 9
\]

Substitute:

\[
2[(y+3)^2 - 9] = -6x - 15
\]

\[
2(y+3)^2 - 18 = -6x - 15
\]

Add 18 to both sides:

\[
2(y+3)^2 = -6x + 3
\]

\[
2(y+3)^2 = -6\left(x - \frac{1}{2}\right)
\]

Divide by 2:

\[
(y+3)^2 = -3\left(x - \frac{1}{2}\right)
\]

This is of the form

\[
(y-k)^2 = 4p(x-h)
\]

with  

\[
h = \frac12,\quad k = -3,\quad 4p = -3 \Rightarrow p = -\frac34.
\]

---

### 2. Vertex

The vertex is \((h,k)\):

\[
V\left(\frac12,-3\right)
\]

---

### 3. Focus

For the form \((y-k)^2 = 4p(x-h)\), the parabola opens right if \(p>0\) and left if \(p<0\).  
Here \(p=-\frac34 < 0\), so it opens to the **left**.

The focus is \((h+p, k)\):

\[
F\left(\frac12 + \left(-\frac34\right), -3\right)
= \left(-\frac14, -3\right)
\]

---

### 4. Directrix

The directrix is the vertical line

\[
x = h - p = \frac12 -\left(-\frac34\right)
= \frac12 + \frac34 = \frac54
\]

---

### 5. Summary for graphing

- Vertex: \(\boxed{\left(\frac12, -3\right)}\)  
- Focus: \(\boxed{\left(-\frac14, -3\right)}\)  
- Directrix: \(\boxed{x = \frac54}\)  
- Axis of symmetry: \(y = -3\)  
- Parabola opens to the left.

**Final answer:**  
\[
(y+3)^2 = -3\left(x-\frac12\right),\quad 
V\left(\frac12,-3\right),\;
F\left(-\frac14,-3\right),\;
\text{directrix } x = \frac54.
