From the graph we can read two clear points on the line:

**1. Find the slope \(m\):**

So the slope is \(m = 2\).

**2. Find the y‑intercept \(b\):**

Since the line passes through \((0,-1)\), that point is directly the y‑intercept, so \(b = -1\).

A town’s population increases at a constant rate. In 2010 the population was 55,000. By 2012 the population had increased to 76,000. If this trend continues, predict the population in 2016.

---

### Step 1: Find the yearly rate of increase

From 2010 to 2012 is 2 years.

Population change in that time:
\[
76{,}000 - 55{,}000 = 21{,}000
\]

Yearly increase:
\[
\frac{21{,}000}{2} = 10{,}500 \text{ people per year}

### Step 2: Find the increase from 2010 to 2016

From 2010 to 2016 is 6 years.

Total increase over 6 years:
\[
6 \times 10{,}500 = 63{,}000

---

### Step 3: Add to the 2010 population

\]

(These are read from the axes: at \(x=5\), \(y=11{,}000\); at \(x=25\), \(y=5{,}000\).)

### 1. Find the slope  
\[
m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
   = \frac{5{,}000 - 11{,}000}{25 - 5}
   = \frac{-6{,}000}{20}

So the slope is \(-300\) (thousand dollars per year).

\[
y - 11{,}000 = -300(x - 5)

We already have
\(n\sum xy - (\sum x)(\sum y) = -315\) and

**Line 1:**

\[

Subtract \(2x\) from both sides:

\[

Divide by \(-6\):

\[
y = \frac{-2}{-6}x + \frac{12}{-6}

So the slope of line 1 is \(m_1 = \frac{1}{3}\).

So Line 1 has slope \(m_1 = 0\) (a horizontal line).

### Slope of Line 2

Line 2 points: \((x_1,y_1)=(-1,3)\), \((x_2,y_2)=(-5,11)\).

**Final answer:** The population will reach 12,000 in the year **2021**.",False,"The correct year from the key is 2027, but the AI computed 2021 due to a mismatch with the intended target population, so the final answer is wrong.",Wrong Answer,False
C4-19,Complete,Incomplete,"We are given ordered pairs in the form (population, year):

- (3600, 2000)  
- (4000, 2001)  
- (4700, 2003)  
- (6000, 2006)

The problem states the population increased *steadily*, so we model it with a linear function:  
\(P(y) = my + b\), where \(P\) is the population and \(y\) is the year.

Use two points to find the slope \(m\).  
Take (3600, 2000) and (4000, 2001):

\[
m = \frac{4000 - 3600}{2001 - 2000} = \frac{400}{1} = 400
\]

So the population increases by 400 people per year.

Now find \(b\) using (3600, 2000):

\[
3600 = 400(2000) + b
\]
\[
3600 = 800{,}000 + b
\]
\[
b = 3600 - 800{,}000 = -796{,}400
\]

Thus,
\[
P(y) = 400y - 796{,}400
\]

To find the population in 2014, plug in \(y = 2014\):

\[
P(2014) = 400(2014) - 796{,}400
\]
\[
P(2014) = 805{,}600 - 796{,}400 = 9{,}200
\]

**Final answer: The population in 2014 is 9,200.**",False,"The expected population in 2014 is 7,660, but the solver computed 9,200, so the math result is incorrect.",Wrong Answer,False
C4-20,Complete,Clarification Needed,"We are told:

- In 2004, population \(=1700\).
- In 2012, population \(=2500\).
- Assume linear change.

### (a) Total population growth 2004–2012

\[
\text{Growth} = 2500 - 1700 = 800
\]

So the population increased by **800 students**.

---

### (b) Average population growth per year

From 2004 to 2012 is \(2012-2004 = 8\) years.

\[
\text{Average yearly growth} = \frac{\text{total growth}}{\text{years}}
= \frac{800}{8} = 100
\]

So the population grows by **100 students per year** on average.

---

### (c) Equation for the population \(P\) \(t\) years after 2004

Let \(t=0\) correspond to year 2004. Then:

- Initial value (intercept): \(P(0)=1700\)
- Slope (rate of change): \(100\) students per year

Linear equation:

\[
P(t) = 1700 + 100t
\]

---

**Final answers:**

(a) \(800\) students  
(b) \(100\) students per year  
(c) \(P(t) = 1700 + 100t\)",True,All three parts match the expected numerical answers and provide the correct linear equation.,Complete,True
