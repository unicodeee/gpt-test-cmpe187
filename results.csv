1. First factor out the greatest common factor (GCF), which is 3:

2. Now factor the quadratic inside the parentheses. We want two numbers that multiply to \(5\) and add to \(6\). Those numbers are \(1\) and \(5\):

3. Complete the square inside the parentheses.  
Take half of \(\frac{1}{2}\), which is \(\frac{1}{4}\), and square it:

\[

### 1. Determine the domain
For square roots to be defined:
\[
3x+7 \ge 0 \quad\Rightarrow\quad x \ge -\frac{7}{3}
\]
\[
x+2 \ge 0 \quad\Rightarrow\quad x \ge -2
\]
So the domain is \(x \ge -2\).

On this domain, both square roots are nonnegative, so their sum is also nonnegative.

### 2. Consider the right-hand side
The right-hand side is 1 (positive). To see if equality is possible, note that if
\[
\sqrt{3x+7} + \sqrt{x+2} = 1,
\]
then in particular each term must be at most 1:
\[
\sqrt{3x+7} \le 1 \quad\text{and}\quad \sqrt{x+2} \le 1.

That gives:
\[
3x + 7 \le 1 \Rightarrow 3x \le -6 \Rightarrow x \le -2,

\[

Combining with the domain \(x \ge -2\), we get the only possible value:

### 1. Find the point of intersection  
Set \(y_1 = y_2\):

\[

Subtract \(x\) from both sides:

\[

This inequality says we want the region where \(y_1 < y_2\), i.e. where the graph of \(y_1 = x+3\) lies **below** the graph of \(y_2 = 3x-4\).

Test a value on each side of the intersection \(x = \frac{7}{2}\).  

Take \(x = 0\) (which is less than \(3.5\)):

- \(y_1 = 0+3 = 3\)
- \(y_2 = 3(0)-4 = -4\)

Here \(y_1 > y_2\), so the inequality \(y_1 < y_2\) is **not** true for \(x<\frac{7}{2}\).

- \(y_1 = 4+3 = 7\)
