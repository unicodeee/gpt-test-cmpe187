C2-09,Accurate,Wrong Answer,"We need to solve:

\[
\sqrt{3x+7} + \sqrt{x+5} = 1

### 1. Determine the domain
Inside each square root we must have a nonnegative number:

\[
3x + 7 \ge 0 \Rightarrow x \ge -\frac{7}{3}
\]
\[
x + 5 \ge 0 \Rightarrow x \ge -5
\]

So overall domain: \(x \ge -\frac{7}{3}\).

### 2. Analyze the equation

Both square roots are **nonnegative** for all \(x\) in the domain.  
Hence their sum is also nonnegative.

But for any \(x\) in the domain:

\[
\sqrt{3x+7} \ge 0,\quad \sqrt{x+5} \ge 0
\]

So

\[
\sqrt{3x+7} + \sqrt{x+5} \ge 0 + 0 = 0
\]

Actually, the only way the sum could be as small as possible is if both terms are 0:

\[
\sqrt{3x+7} = 0 \Rightarrow 3x+7=0 \Rightarrow x = -\frac{7}{3}
\]
\[
\sqrt{x+5} = 0 \Rightarrow x+5=0 \Rightarrow x = -5
\]

These give **different** values of \(x\); therefore there is no \(x\) for which both radicals are zero at the same time. Hence for every admissible \(x\),

\[
\sqrt{3x+7}+\sqrt{x+5} > 0
\]

In particular, can this sum ever equal 1?

Test the endpoints/behavior:

At \(x=-\frac{7}{3}\):

\[
\sqrt{3(-\tfrac{7}{3}) + 7} + \sqrt{-\tfrac{7}{3}+5}
= \sqrt{0} + \sqrt{\tfrac{8}{3}} = \sqrt{\tfrac{8}{3}} > 1
\]

As \(x\) increases, both \(3x+7\) and \(x+5\) increase, so each square root increases, and their sum increases further. So the sum is **always greater than 1** for every \(x\) in the domain.

Thus the equation
\[
\sqrt{3x+7} + \sqrt{x+5} = 1
\]

### 1. Check if it’s linear

For a linear function, the rate of change (slope) between any two points must be the same.

Compute slopes between pairs of points:

1. Between \((6,-8)\) and \((8,-12)\):

\[
m = \frac{-12 - (-8)}{8 - 6} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2
\]

2. Between \((8,-12)\) and \((12,-18)\):

\[
m = \frac{-18 - (-12)}{12 - 8} = \frac{-6}{4} = -\frac{3}{2}
\]

The slopes \(-2\) and \(-\frac{3}{2}\) are not equal.  
Since the slopes between points are different, the data do **not** lie on a single straight line.

Therefore, the table **does not represent a linear function**, and there is no single linear equation that models all of the data.

Given equations:
1) \(2x - 6y = 12\)
2) \(-x + 3y = 1\)

**Step 1: Put each equation into slope-intercept form \(y = mx + b\).**

1) \(2x - 6y = 12\)

\[
-6y = -2x + 12
\]
\[
y = \frac{-2}{-6}x + \frac{12}{-6}
\]
\[
y = \frac{1}{3}x - 2

So the slope of the first line is \(m_1 = \frac{1}{3}\).

- **Line 1** passes through \((5,1)\) and \((10,1)\).  
- **Line 2** passes through \((-1,3)\) and \((-5,11)\).

---

### Slope of Line 1

Use the slope formula \(m = \dfrac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\).

For Line 1:
\[
m_1 = \frac{1 - 1}{10 - 5} = \frac{0}{5} = 0

So Line 1 has slope \(m_1 = 0\) (a horizontal line).

### Slope of Line 2

For Line 2, with points \((-1,3)\) and \((-5,11)\):
\[
m_2 = \frac{11 - 3}{-5 - (-1)}

**Step 1: Plot the y-intercept**

When \(t = 0\):  
\[
f(0) = 2(0) - 5 = -5
\]
So the graph passes through the point \((0, -5)\).

**Step 2: Use the slope**

Slope \(2\) means “rise 2 units for every 1 unit to the right.”

Starting from \((0, -5)\), move:
- right 1 unit to \(t = 1\)
- up 2 units to \(y = -3\)

So another point on the line is \((1, -3)\).

- \(2^{x+1} - 3\): shift the whole graph down by 3 units.

This vertical shift:
- keeps the domain the same: still all real numbers.
- moves the range from \((0,\infty)\) to \((-3,\infty)\) (subtracting 3 from all \(y\)-values).
- moves the horizontal asymptote from \(y=0\) to \(y=-3\).

### 3. Graph description
The graph is an increasing exponential curve that approaches \(y=-3\) from above as \(x\to -\infty\) and rises rapidly as \(x\to\infty\).

- \(T_0 = 40^\circ F\) (initial water temperature),  
- \(T(t)\) is water temperature at time \(t\) (hours),

C6-11,Complete,Wrong answer,"We are given the exponential function  

\[
f(x) = 3.5(2)^x
\]

### 1. Graph behavior  
This is an exponential growth function with base \(2>1\) and vertical stretch factor \(3.5\).  
- It passes through the point \((0, 3.5)\).  
- As \(x\) increases, the function values grow quickly.  
- As \(x \to -\infty\), \(2^x \to 0\), so \(f(x) \to 0\) from above (never reaching 0).  
So the horizontal asymptote is the \(x\)-axis: \(y=0\).

Some sample points for plotting:
- \(x=-2:\; f(-2) = 3.5 \cdot 2^{-2} = 3.5 \cdot \frac14 = 0.875\)
- \(x=-1:\; f(-1)=3.5\cdot\frac12 = 1.75\)
- \(x=0:\; f(0)=3.5\)
- \(x=1:\; f(1)=7\)
- \(x=2:\; f(2)=14\)

Plot these and sketch a smooth curve increasing from near \(y=0\) on the left, through these points, going up to the right.

### 2. Domain  
For exponential functions \(a b^x\) with \(b>0, b\neq 1\), the domain is all real numbers.  
\[
\boxed{\text{Domain: } (-\infty, \infty)}
\]

### 3. Range  
Since \(3.5>0\) and \(2^x>0\) for all real \(x\), their product is always positive, and can be any positive number but never 0.  
\[
\boxed{\text{Range: } (0, \infty)}
\]

### 4. \(y\)-intercept  
The \(y\)-intercept is \(f(0)\):
\[
f(0) = 3.5(2)^0 = 3.5 \cdot 1 = 3.5
\]
So the graph crosses the \(y\)-axis at \((0, 3.5)\).

C6-12,Accurate,Wrong answer,"We are told the original function is  

\[
f(x) = 2^x
\]

and we must determine the transformed equation from the graph.

From the picture:

- The horizontal asymptote of the new graph is at \(y = -2\) (the curve levels off near \(-2\) as \(x \to -\infty\)).  
  That means there is a **vertical shift downward by 2 units**, so we have something of the form  

  \[
  y = a\cdot 2^{x} - 2
  \]

- The curve appears to pass through the point \((2,0)\) (the x‑intercept is at \(x=2\)).  
  Substitute \((x,y) = (2,0)\) into \(y = a\cdot 2^{x} - 2\):

  \[
  0 = a\cdot 2^{2} - 2 \quad\Rightarrow\quad 0 = 4a - 2
  \]

  \[
  4a = 2 \quad\Rightarrow\quad a = \frac12

Thus the equation is  

\[
y = \frac12 \cdot 2^{x} - 2.
\]

You can also write \(\frac12 \cdot 2^{x} = 2^{x-1}\), so another equivalent form is \(y = 2^{x-1} - 2\).

So the domain is \(\boxed{(-5,\infty)}\).

### 2. Vertical Asymptote
A logarithmic function has a vertical asymptote where its argument is 0:
\[
4x + 20 = 0 \Rightarrow x = -5

\[
3\log_7 v = \log_7(v^3), \quad
6\log_7 w = \log_7(w^6), \quad
\frac{\log_7 u}{3} = \log_7(u^{1/3})

So the expression becomes

**Step 2: Expand \(\ln(2b)\)**

\[

Substitute:

\[

### Step 2: Simplify the denominator

\[

This is in the standard form

with center at the origin \((0,0)\).  
Here \(a^2 = 36\) and \(b^2 = 9\).

So:

\[
a = \sqrt{36} = 6,\qquad b = \sqrt{9} = 3
\]

Because \(a > b\) and the \(a^2\) term is under \(x^2\), the major axis is horizontal.

To find the foci, use

\[
c^2 = a^2 - b^2 = 36 - 9 = 27 \quad\Rightarrow\quad c = \sqrt{27} = 3\sqrt{3}

The foci lie on the major (horizontal) axis, so their coordinates are \((\pm c, 0)\).

> A whispering gallery is to be constructed such that the foci are located 35 feet from the center.  
> If the length of the gallery is to be 100 feet, what should the height of the ceiling be?

A whispering gallery cross‑section is an ellipse.  

Let the gallery run horizontally along the major axis.

- Distance from center to each focus: \(c = 35\) ft  
- Total length of gallery: \(2a = 100\) ft  ⇒  \(a = 50\) ft  
- Let the height (semi‑minor axis) be \(b\) ft.

For an ellipse centered at the origin:

\[
\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1,\quad
c^2 = a^2 - b^2
\]

So

\[
b^2 = a^2 - c^2 = 50^2 - 35^2
\]

Compute:

\[
50^2 = 2500,\quad 35^2 = 1225

\[
b^2 = 2500 - 1225 = 1275

\[
b = \sqrt{1275}

C8-07,Step-by-Step,Wrong Answer,"We are given:

- Foci at \((3,7)\) and \((7,7)\)  
- A vertex at \((6,7)\)

### 1. Find the center and orientation
The foci are horizontally aligned (same \(y\)-coordinate).  
The center is the midpoint of the foci:
\[
\left(\frac{3+7}{2}, \frac{7+7}{2}\right) = (5,7).
\]

Since the transverse axis is horizontal, the hyperbola has the form
\[
\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1,
\]
with center \((h,k) = (5,7)\).

### 2. Use the vertex to find \(a\)
Vertices lie on the transverse axis at \((h \pm a, k)\).

One vertex is \((6,7)\), so
\[
(h+a, k) = (6,7) \Rightarrow 5 + a = 6 \Rightarrow a = 1,
\]
thus \(a^2 = 1\).

### 3. Use the foci to find \(c\), then \(b^2\)
Foci are \((h \pm c, k)\).  
Take one focus, say \((7,7)\):
\[
(h+c, k) = (7,7) \Rightarrow 5 + c = 7 \Rightarrow c = 2,
\]
so \(c^2 = 4\).

For a hyperbola, \(c^2 = a^2 + b^2\), so
\[
4 = 1 + b^2 \Rightarrow b^2 = 3.
\]

### 4. Write the equation
\[
\boxed{\frac{(x-5)^2}{1} - \frac{(y-7)^2}{3} = 1}

Match the given equation to this form:

\[
(x+2)^2 = \frac12 (y-1)

Here,
- \(h = -2\)

- \(4p = \frac12\)

Solve for \(p\):
\[
4p = \frac12 \quad\Rightarrow\quad p = \frac{1}{8}

Since \(p>0\), the parabola opens **upward**.

This is a parabola in the **sideways** form  

\[

\]

where \((h,k)\) is the vertex and \(p\) tells how far the focus and directrix are from the vertex.  

Match terms:

\[
(y-1)^2 = \frac12 (x+3)
\]

So
- \(h = -3\)  
- \(k = 1\)  
- \(4p = \frac12 \Rightarrow p = \frac{1}{8}\)

Since \(p > 0\), the parabola opens to the **right**.

**Vertex**

\[
V = (h,k) = (-3, 1)
\]

**Focus**

For a right–opening parabola, the focus is \(p\) units to the right of the vertex:

\[
F = (h + p, k) = \left(-3 + \frac18,\ 1\right)
= \left(-\frac{23}{8},\ 1\right)
\]

**Directrix**

The directrix is a vertical line \(p\) units to the left of the vertex:

\[
x = h - p = -3 - \frac18 = -\frac{25}{8}
\]

**Axis of symmetry**

Horizontal line through the vertex:

\[
y = 1
\]

**Intercepts**

- **x-intercept**: set \(y = 0\):

  \[
  (0 - 1)^2 = \tfrac12(x+3)
  \Rightarrow 1 = \tfrac12(x+3)
  \Rightarrow 2 = x + 3
  \Rightarrow x = -1
  \]

  So x-intercept: \((-1, 0)\).

- **y-intercept**: set \(x = 0\):

  \[
  (y - 1)^2 = \tfrac12(0+3) = \tfrac32
  \Rightarrow y - 1 = \pm \sqrt{\tfrac32}
  \Rightarrow y = 1 \pm \sqrt{\tfrac32}

So the parabola passes through \(\left(0,\ 1 \pm \sqrt{\tfrac32}\right)\).

Distance to focus:

Cancel \(y^2\) and collect like terms:

C8-19,Step-by-Step,Wrong Answer,"We are given the equation

\[
2y^2 + 12y + 6x + 15 = 0
\]

We want to write it in standard form for a sideways parabola and then identify vertex, focus, and directrix.

---

### 1. Rearrange and complete the square in \(y\)

Group the \(y\)-terms and move the \(x\) and constant to the other side:

\[
2y^2 + 12y = -6x - 15
\]

Factor out 2 on the left:

\[
2(y^2 + 6y) = -6x - 15
\]

Complete the square inside the parentheses:

\[
y^2 + 6y = y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9
\]

Substitute:

\[
2[(y+3)^2 - 9] = -6x - 15
\]

\[
2(y+3)^2 - 18 = -6x - 15
\]

Add 18 to both sides:

\[
2(y+3)^2 = -6x + 3
\]

Factor the right side:

\[
-6x + 3 = -6\left(x - \frac{1}{2}\right)
\]

Thus:

\[
2(y+3)^2 = -6\left(x - \frac{1}{2}\right)
\]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[
(y+3)^2 = -3\left(x - \frac{1}{2}\right)
\]

---

### 2. Compare with standard form

Standard form of a horizontal parabola:

\[
(y-k)^2 = 4p(x-h)
\]

Here:

\[
(y+3)^2 = -3\left(x - \tfrac{1}{2}\right)
\]

So:

- \(h = \dfrac{1}{2}\)
- \(k = -3\)
- \(4p = -3 \Rightarrow p = -\dfrac{3}{4}\)

---

### 3. Vertex, focus, and directrix

- **Vertex**: \((h, k) = \left(\dfrac{1}{2}, -3\right)\)

- For a horizontal parabola, focus is at \((h+p, k)\):

\[
h + p = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{3}{4} = -\frac{1}{4}
\]
So **focus**: \(\left(-\dfrac{1}{4}, -3\right)\)

- Directrix is the vertical line \(x = h - p\):

\[
h - p = \frac{1}{2} - \left(-\frac{3}{4}\right) = \frac{5}{4}
\]
So **directrix**: \(x = \dfrac{5}{4}\)

Because \(p < 0\), the parabola opens to the left.

---

**Final answer**

- Standard form: \((y+3)^2 = -3\left(x - \dfrac{1}{2}\right)\)  
- Vertex: \(\boxed{\left(\dfrac{1}{2}, -3\right)}\)  
- Focus: \(\boxed{\left(-\dfrac{1}{4}, -3\right)}\)  
- Directrix: \(\boxed{x = \dfrac{5}{4}}\)  
- The parabola opens leftward.",True,"The solution correctly converts the equation to standard form, identifies vertex, focus, and directrix, and matches the expected graph, with clear step-by-step work.",Step-by-Step,True
