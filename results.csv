Use the compound interest formula:
\[
A = P\left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}

Plug in the given values:

### 1. Start with the base function
The basic exponential is \(g(x)=2^x\).

- Domain of \(2^x\): all real numbers \((-\infty,\infty)\).
- Range of \(2^x\): \( (0,\infty) \).
- Horizontal asymptote: \(y=0\).

### 2. Transformations to get \(f(x)\)

1. \(2^{x+1}\): shifting \(2^x\) left by 1 unit.  
   This does not change the domain, range, or asymptote.
2. \(2^{x+1}-3\): shifting the graph down by 3 units.  

This affects:
- Range: shift \( (0,\infty) \) down by 3 → \( (-3,\infty) \).
- Asymptote: \(y=0\) shifts down by 3 → \(y=-3\).

The domain remains all real numbers because exponential functions are defined for every real \(x\), and horizontal/vertical shifts do not change that.

### (a) Exponential regression model

To do exponential regression, we linearize the equation by taking natural logs:

where  
- \(P = 8500\) (initial deposit),  
- \(r = 0.0812\) (annual interest rate as a decimal),

For an exponential transformation we expect an equation of the form  

\[

where  

- \(h\) is a horizontal shift,  
- \(k\) is a vertical shift (also the horizontal asymptote \(y=k\)),  
- \(a\) is a vertical stretch or reflection.

---

### 1. Identify the horizontal asymptote  

From the graph, the curve approaches the line \(y = -2\) as \(x \to -\infty\).  
So the vertical shift is \(k = -2\).

Thus,

\[
g(x) = a\cdot 2^{(x-h)} - 2
\]

---

### 2. Use a clear point on the graph  

The curve crosses the x-axis at about \(x=2\) (i.e., it passes through \((2,0)\)).

Substitute \((x,y) = (2,0)\):

\[
0 = a\cdot 2^{(2-h)} - 2
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
a\cdot 2^{(2-h)} = 2
\]

\[
a\cdot 2^{(2-h)} = 2^1
\]

To keep the graph shape (no reflection, normal steepness), take \(a = 1\). Then  

\[
2^{(2-h)} = 2^1 \Rightarrow 2-h = 1 \Rightarrow h = 1.
\]

So we have  

\[
g(x) = 2^{x-1} - 2.

Check: the asymptote is \(y=-2\), and at \(x=2\):  
\(g(2) = 2^{1} - 2 = 0\), matching the graph.

**Step 2: Use product and quotient rules**

Product rule:

Substitute:

### Step 3: Combine exponents on the left

N(t) = \frac{1200}{1+119e^{-0.225t}}
\]

where \(N(t)\) is the number of people who have heard the rumor after \(t\) days.

The carrying capacity is the horizontal asymptote of the logistic function, which is the numerator:  
\[
K = 1200
\]

Half the carrying capacity is  
\[
\frac{K}{2} = \frac{1200}{2} = 600
\]

Set \(N(t) = 600\) and solve for \(t\):

\[
600 = \frac{1200}{1+119e^{-0.225t}}
\]

Multiply both sides by the denominator:

\[
600(1+119e^{-0.225t}) = 1200
\]

Divide both sides by 600:

\[
1 + 119e^{-0.225t} = 2
\]

\[
119e^{-0.225t} = 1
\]

\[
e^{-0.225t} = \frac{1}{119}
\]

Take natural logarithms:

\[
-0.225t = \ln\!\left(\frac{1}{119}\right)
       = -\ln(119)
\]

\[
t = \frac{\ln(119)}{0.225}
\]

Compute:

\[
\ln(119) \approx 4.7791
\]

\[
t \approx \frac{4.7791}{0.225} \approx 21.24
\]

Rounded to the nearest tenth:

\[
\boxed{21.2\ \text{days}}
