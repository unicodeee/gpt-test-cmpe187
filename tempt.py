	'reference': "Based on the image, this dish appears to be a type of pasta with tofu and garnished with sesame seeds, herbs, and what looks like red chili flakes. Tofu is plant-based and suitable for vegans. However, without a clear indication from the restaurant or packaging that all ingredients are vegan (such as no animal-derived oils or seasonings), it cannot be confirmed with absolute certainty if it's safe for a vegan to eat.\n\nCommon concerns include whether there are any non-vegan oils used in cooking (like butter or lard), whether soy sauce was added (which can contain fish sauce), or if there were any other animal-derived products used in seasoning. Additionally, some restaurants may use cross-contaminated utensils when preparing different types of food.\n\nTherefore, while tofu itself is vegan-friendly based on its visual identification in this image alone, one should ideally ask the restaurant directly about their specific preparation methods to ensure that all ingredients are suitable for a vegan diet.",
